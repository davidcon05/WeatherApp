# [Jetpack Compose Weather Tutorial Project] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAbKK7JNxCE&t=78s&ab_channel=PhilippLackner)
This is a tutorial project by Phillip Lackner for learning about:
1. Jetpack Compose
2. Clean Architecture
3. MVI
4. DI with Hilt
5. Google Location Services
6. Retrofit


## [Clean Architecture] (https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
There are three layers in this project:
1. Presentation Layer - UI 
   1. ViewModels, Composables
2. Domain Layer - Business Logic
   1. UsesCases, Entities, Repositories; the core logic of the app
3. Data Layer - Data Access
   1. DataSources, Mappers, Models; things that interact with the outside world# PLWeather

This is a smaller project so there layout uses a data, domain, presentation structure. For a larger 
project a feature based structure would be better.
